# Minutes and debate auto recorder AI
you should record a voice or keep writing a record of the process and results of the meeting During most of business meetings 
If you listen to the recorded minutes again, you will have to listen to the contents of the meeting for a long time, meaninglessly. 
If there is a clerk of the meeting and the clerk writes the minutes, clerk may omit the details of the meeting.


However, if AI replaces the writing and recording process in the meeting minutes?
you can dramatically reduce the amount of the time consuming jobs and the missed contents of the meeting!
